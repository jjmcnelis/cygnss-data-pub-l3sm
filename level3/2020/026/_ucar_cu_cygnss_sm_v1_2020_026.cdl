Soil moisture estimates were produced by calculating the slope of the best-fit linear regression between SMAP soil moisture and CYGNSS \'effective reflectivity\', which gives reflectivity corrected for antenna gain, range, and GPS transmit power. The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) is a constellation of eight small satellites designed to observe ocean surface wind speed during hurricanes (PI Chris Ruf, University of Michigan); it is a NASA Earth Ventures Mission that was launched in December of 2016. These satellites employ a relatively new remote sensing technique called GNSS-Reflectometry (GNSS-R), which records L-band signals transmitted by navigation satellites that have reflected off of the Earthâ€™s surface and back into space." ;
