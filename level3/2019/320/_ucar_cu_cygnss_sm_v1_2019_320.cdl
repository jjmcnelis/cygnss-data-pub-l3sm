CYGNSS is a constellation of eight small satellites designed to observe ocean surface wind speed during hurricanes (PI Chris Ruf, University of Michigan); it is a NASA Earth Ventures Mission that was launched in December of 2016. These satellites employ a relatively new remote sensing technique called GNSS-Reflectometry (GNSS-R), which records L-band signals transmitted by navigation satellites that have reflected off of the Earthâ€™s surface and back into space. Soil moisture estimates were produced by calculating the slope of the best-fit linear regression between SMAP soil moisture and CYGNSS \'effective reflectivity\', which gives reflectivity corrected for antenna gain, range, and GPS transmit power." ;
